    - An absolute triumph of storytelling that kept me hooked from start to finish.
    - Brilliant performances and a heartwarming finale make this a must-see.
    - A visually stunning masterpiece with an unforgettable score.
    - Heavy on clich√©s and light on originality, it feels like a tired retread.
    - Sluggish pacing and wooden acting make this an endurance test.
    - Dialogue so forced it took me right out of the story.
